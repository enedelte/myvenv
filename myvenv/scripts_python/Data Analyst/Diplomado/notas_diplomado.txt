descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics


Descriptive Analytics. It consists of describing current situations
and reporting on them.
Several techniques are employed to perform this level
of analytics. For instance, descriptive statistics tools like
histograms and charts are among the techniques used in
descriptive analytics.
Diagnostic Analysis. It aims to explain why certain events
occurred and what the factors that triggered them are. For
example, diagnostic analysis attempts to understand the
reasons behind the regular readmission of some patients by
using several methods such as clustering and decision trees.
Predictive Analytics. It reflects the ability to predict future
events; it also helps in identifying trends and determining
probabilities of uncertain outcomes. An illustration of its
role is to predict whether a patient can get complications or
not. Predictive models are often built usingmachine learning
techniques.
